\description{
Extract Standardized Residuals from KFS output
}
\details{
For object of class KFS with fully Gaussian observations, several
  types of standardized residuals can be computed. Also the standardization
  for multivariate residuals can be done either by Cholesky decomposition
  \eqn{L^{-1}_t residual_t,}{L^(-1)[t]residual[t]} or component-wise
  \eqn{residual_t/sd(residual_t),}{residual[t]/sd(residual[t])}.

  \itemize{
  \item "recursive": For Gaussian models the vector standardized one-step ahead prediction
  residuals are defined as
  \deqn{v_{t,i}/\sqrt{F_{i,t}},}{v[t,i]/\sqrt{F[i,t]},} with residuals
  being undefined in diffuse phase. Note that even in multivariate case these
  standardized residuals coincide with the ones obtained from the Kalman
  filter without the sequential processing (which is not true for the
  non-standardized innovations).
  For non-Gaussian models the vector standardized recursive residuals are obtained as
  \deqn{L^{-1}_t (y_{t}-\mu_{t}),}{L^(-1)[t](y[t]-\mu[t]),} where
  \eqn{L_t}{L[t]} is the lower triangular matrix from Cholesky decomposition
  of \eqn{Var(y_t|y_{t-1},\ldots,y_1)}{Var(y[t]|y[t-1],\ldots,y[1])}. Computing these for large
  non-Gaussian models can be time consuming as filtering is needed.

  For Gaussian models the component-wise standardized one-step ahead prediction
  residuals are defined as
  \deqn{v_{t}/\sqrt{diag(F_{t})},}{v[t])/\sqrt{diag(F[t])},} where \eqn{v_{t}}{v[t]} and
  \eqn{F_{t}}{F[t]} are based on the standard multivariate processing.
  For non-Gaussian models these are obtained as
  \deqn{(y_{t}-\mu_{t})/\sqrt{diag(F_t)},}{(y[t]-\mu[t])/\sqrt{diag(F[t])},} where
  \eqn{F_t=Var(y_t|y_{t-1},\ldots,y_1)}{F[t]=Var(y[t]|y[t-1],\ldots,y[1])}.

  \item "state":  Residuals based on the smoothed state disturbance terms
  \eqn{\eta} are defined as \deqn{L^{-1}_t \hat \eta_t, \quad
  t=1,\ldots,n,}{L^{-1}[t] \hat \eta[t], t=1,\ldots,n,} where \eqn{L_t}{L[t]} is
  either the lower triangular matrix from Cholesky decomposition of
  \eqn{Q_t - V_{\eta,t}}{Q[t] - V[\eta,t]}, or the diagonal of the same matrix.

  \item 'pearson':  Standardized Pearson residuals
  \deqn{L^{-1}_t(y_{t}-\theta_{i}), \quad t=1,\ldots,n,}{L^(-1)[t](y[t]-\theta[t]), t=1,\ldots,n,} where
  \eqn{L_t}{L[t]} is the lower triangular matrix from Cholesky decomposition
  of \eqn{Var(y_t|y_{n},\ldots,y_1)}{Var(y[t]|y[n],\ldots,y[1])}, or the diagonal of the same
  matrix. For Gaussian models, these coincide with the standardized smoothed
  \eqn{\epsilon} disturbance residuals, and for generalized linear models
  these coincide with the standardized Pearson residuals (hence the name).


\item 'deviance': Deviance residuals. Deprecated. This option was meant to be
used only for the GLM comparisons, as their generalization to other models is
lacking, but these will be completely removed in future in order to avoid
misleading results in non-GLM settings. }
