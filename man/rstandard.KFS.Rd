Extract Standardized Residuals from KFS output
}
\details{
For object of class KFS, several types of standardized
residuals can be computed: \itemize{

\item 'recursive': One-step ahead prediction residuals
defined as \deqn{v_{t,i})/\sqrt{F_{i,t}},} with residuals
being undefined in diffuse phase. Only supported for fully
Gaussian models.

\item 'pearson': Standardized Pearson residuals
\deqn{(y_{t,i}-\theta_{t,i})/\sqrt{V(\mu)_{t,i}\phi_i\sqrt{1-h_{t,i}}},
\quad
i=1,\ldots,p,t=1,\ldots,n,}{(y[t,i]-\theta[t,i])/(V(\mu)[t,i]\phi[i](1-h[t,i]))^0.5,
i=1,\ldots,p, t=1,\ldots,n,} where
\eqn{V(\mu_{t,i})}{V(\mu[t,i])} is the variance function of
the model, \eqn{\phi_i}{\phi[i]} is the dispersion
parameter and \eqn{h_{t,i}}{h[t,i]} is the hat value.  For
gaussian models, these coincide with the smoothed
\eqn{\epsilon} disturbance residuals.

\item 'state': Residuals based on the smoothed disturbance
terms \eqn{\eta} are defined as \deqn{L^{-1}_t \hat \eta_t,
\quad t=1,\ldots,n,}{L^{-1}[t] \eta[t], t=1,\ldots,n,}
where \eqn{L_t}{L[t]} is the lower triangular matrix from
Cholesky decomposition of \eqn{V_{\eta,t}}{V[\eta,t]}.

\item 'deviance': Deviance residuals. }
