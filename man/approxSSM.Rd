\description{
Function \code{approxSMM} computes the linear Gaussian
approximation of a state space model where observations
follow an exponential family distribution.
}
\details{
The linear Gaussian approximating model is defined by
\deqn{\tilde y_t = Z_t \alpha_t + \epsilon_t, \quad
\epsilon_t \sim N(0,\tilde H_t),}{ytilde[t] = Z[t]\alpha[t]
+ \epsilon[t], \epsilon[t] ~ N(0,Htilde[t]),}
\deqn{\alpha_{t+1} = T_t \alpha_t + R_t \eta_t, \quad
\eta_t \sim N(0,Q_t),}{\alpha[t+1] = T[t]\alpha[t] +
R[t]\eta[t], \eta[t] ~ N(0,Q[t]),} and \eqn{\alpha_1 \sim
N(a_1,P_1)}{\alpha[1] ~ N(a[1],P[1])}, where \eqn{\tilde
y}{ytilde} and \eqn{\tilde H}{Htilde} are chosen in a way
that the linear Gaussian approximating model has the same
conditional mode of \eqn{\theta=Z\alpha} given the
observations \eqn{y} as the original non-gaussian model.
Models also have a same curvature at the mode.

The approximation of the exponential family state space
model is based on iterative weighted least squares method,
see McCullagh and Nelder (1983) p.31 and Durbin Koopman
(2012) p. 243.
