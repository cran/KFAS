\title{Simulation of a Gaussian State Space Model}
\usage{
simulateSSM(object, type = c("states", "signals", "disturbances",
  "observations", "epsilon", "eta"), filtered = FALSE, nsim = 1,
  antithetics = FALSE, conditional = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Gaussian state space object of class \code{SSModel}.}

\item{type}{What to simulate.}

\item{filtered}{Simulate from \eqn{p(\alpha_t|y_{t-1},...,y_1)}{p(\alpha[t]|y[t-1],...,y[1])}
instead of \eqn{p(\alpha|y)}.}

\item{nsim}{Number of independent samples. Default is 1.}

\item{antithetics}{Use antithetic variables in simulation. Default is FALSE.}

\item{conditional}{Simulations are conditional to data. If FALSE, the initial state
\eqn{\alpha_1}{\alpha[1]} is set to \code{alphahat[1,]} computed by \code{KFS},
and all the observations are removed from the model. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
An n x k x nsim array containing the simulated series, where k is number of observations,
  signals, states or disturbances.
}
\description{
Function \code{simulateSMM} simulates states, signals, disturbances or missing observations of
the Gaussian state space model.
}
\details{
Simulation smoother algorithm is based to article by J. Durbin and S.J. Koopman (2002).

Function can use two antithetic variables, one for location and other for scale, so output
contains four blocks of simulated values which correlate which each other (ith block correlates
negatively with (i+1)th block, and positively with (i+2)th block etc.).
