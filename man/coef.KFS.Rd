\title{Extract Estimated States of State Space Model}
\usage{
\method{coef}{KFS}(object, start = NULL, end = NULL, filtered = FALSE,
  ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{object}{An object of class \code{KFS}.}

  \item{start}{The start time of the period of interest.
  Defaults to first time point of the object}

  \item{end}{The end time of the period of interest.
  Defaults to the last time point of the object.}

  \item{filtered}{Logical, return filtered instead of
  smoothed estimates of state vector. Default is
  \code{FALSE}.}

  \item{\dots}{Ignored.}
}
\value{
Multivariate time series containing estimates states.
}
\description{
Extracts the estimates states from output of \code{KFS}.
For non-Gaussian models without simulation, these are
estimates of conditional modes of states. For Gaussian
models and non-Gaussian models with importance sampling,
these are estimates of conditional means of states.
